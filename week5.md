title: Week 5 - 3D Design & Printing
---

This week I played around with 3D scanning apps and PrusaSlicer. I tried the apps ScandyPro, Qlone, and Capture. Qlone ended up requiring a payment, so I tried both ScandyPro and Capture. Since I have an iPhone XR, and not an iPhone 12 Pro, I had to rely on my front facing camera for true depth sensing. This proved to be a little difficult to get an even scan of my object, especially since I didn't have anything to rotate my banana on.

I knew I wanted to print a banana, because my blockmate's 3D printed banana broke last year (I can't remember how it got broken). I figured I would use this opportunity to gift him a new one. I got a couple bananas from the dining hall and chose the best looking one as my model. I couldn't get the banana to stand on its own, so I used a few Jenga blocks to support it. 

Here's my attempt! This one is using the ScandyPro app. It was incredibly difficult to scan the banana with the front facing camera. I kept accidentally getting my knees, hair, and also kept scanning too fast, so that I would end up with a banana mutant thing.
