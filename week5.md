title: Week 5 - 3D Design & Printing
---

This week I played around with 3D scanning apps and PrusaSlicer. I tried the apps ScandyPro, Qlone, and Capture. Qlone ended up requiring a payment, so I tried both ScandyPro and Capture. Since I have an iPhone XR, and not an iPhone 12 Pro, I had to rely on my front facing camera for true depth sensing. This proved to be a little difficult to get an even scan of my object.

Here's my attempt!
