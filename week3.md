I don't consider myself an artist by any means, but I was excited to take on the challenge of building a kinetic sculpture! I have all kinds of random objects around my room, but when I found the mini hand my friend got me a couple years ago, I knew I had to use it. After I got my motor working with the potentiometer and attached the D-shaped piece, I took it for a spin!

I wanted to cover up the motor and the Metro M0 board, so I just cut a small hole in a Harvard-related box I had.

I knew I wanted the hand to be a center piece, but what to do from there? I decided to cut off a wire clothes hanger and just play around with it from there. The black wire from our kit was very handy, and I also heavily relied on Scotch tape for this week's assignment. Shoutout to Scotch tape, you're a real one.

For no particular reason, I settled on a triangular shape to frame the hand in the middle. To stabilize the entire structure and to attach the frame to the hand, I added a center vertical wire to support everything and hold everything together. There were still some stability issues (read: very wobbly), but I just went with it.

With the overall structure complete, I started to add accessories! I wanted to cover up the ugly tape at the top, so I added a bow and a little dangly jewel, and now the structure started to look like a christmas tree?

Because of the way my sculpture is built, all of the embellishments I added had to be light. The structure was already wobbly and so adding heavy objects wouldn't help. I also needed to add equal weight to both sides so the weight would be balanced. I found two little koalas and had them cling to each side.

Complete! I fiddled with the overall structure to center it a bit more to minimize wobbly-ness.

I'm not sure what I built. Maybe a carousel or something you'd find on a playground? In any case, this assignment really taught me how a little can go a long way. The ability to connect and run a motor opens up so many possibilities and so many things I can build!
