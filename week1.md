title: Week 1 - Project Proposal
---

My idea is to build something for my dog. Originally, I was thinking I'd build him a dog toy, maybe a mechanical ball thrower that would throw the ball in different directions. However, I'm not too sure when I'll be able to go home next, and because I live in Australia, it would have to be something that is portable and convenient to transport.

Currently, I'm thinking about creating some kind of smart-tech, either a smart leash or a smart collar. I've always wanted to create some kind of "smart watch" for my dog. Maybe something that could track his running speed and the number of steps taken? Although I'm currently on campus, my resident tutor living next door has a 4-month old puppy, and maybe I could test the product on her puppy. 

Since I have no background in electronics/engineering/building, I'd love to know if this idea is possible and/or doable. I'm not totally in love with this idea because ideally I'd want to create something more creative! I'll drop in one of the lab sessions this week to discuss further :)
